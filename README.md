# IO DIF

Blender plugin to import and export MBG Torque DIF interiors.

## Note

The difs generated by this plugin ONLY work in Marble Blast not because of the dif versions but because of the very way the difs are constructed. A lot of stuff is not generated because MB does not require it and some unconventional algorithms are used which specifically make use of how MB makes use of difs. The collision **WILL** not work anywhere outside MB. Even raycasts don't work.

## Features

### Import DIF

- Powered by [hxDIF](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/hxDIF)
- Supports PathedInteriors and its path
- Supports embedded GameEntities with properties
- Supports loading textures

### Export DIF

- Powered by [DifBuilder](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/DifBuilder)
- Export support for PathedInteriors and Markers
- Export support for GameEntities and its properties
- Additional export parameters provided by [obj2difPlus](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/obj2difPlus)

## Installation

Download the plugin from Releases and install it how you normally install blender plugins.

## How to

### Import

File > Import > Torque (.dif).  
It can't be any more simpler than that

### Export

File > Export > Torque (.dif)

#### Additional export options

Flip Faces: Flip the normals of the dif, incase the resultant dif is inside out.  
Double Faces: Make all the faces double sided, may increase lag during collision detection.

### DIF Properties Panel

Located in the object properties panel

- Interior Entity Type:
  - InteriorResource: normal static interior type
  - PathedInterior: moving platform type interior
    - Marker Path: a curve object that describes the path of the moving platform
      - initialPathPosition: set using the "Evaluation Time" parameter located in Curve > Object Data Properties > Path Animation
      - totalPathTime: time it takes for the moving platform to complete the path, set using the "Frames" parameter located in Curve > Object Data Properties > Path Animation.
  - Game Entity: represents an entity in the dif such as items
    - Game Class: the class of the entity such as "Item", "StaticShape",etc
    - Datablock: the datablock of the item.
    - Properties: a list of additional key value pairs which will be set to the object on Create Subs

## Limitations

- Sometimes difs are broken. To fix them, theres a few methods:
  - Split the object file either manually or use the "Polygons per DIF" option in Export DIF
  - Move the object somewhere else
- No Trigger support: I tried but Torque was being Torque even when I successfully embedded them into difs.
- No Game Entity rotation support: there isnt even a rotation field for Game Entities in difs, and torque doesnt even use the rotation field explicitly passed as a property

## Build

Checkout the repository correctly

```
git checkout https://github.com/RandomityGuy/io_dif.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
git submodule foreach git submodule init
git submodule foreach git submodule update
```

Then build DifBuilderLib.dll using CMake.  
Copy resultant DifBuilderLib.dll to blender_plugin/io_dif folder.  
Copy blender_plugin/io_dif to your blender plugins folder.
